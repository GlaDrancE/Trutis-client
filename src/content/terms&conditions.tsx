                <p className="mb-4">
                    [These Terms govern your use of the Entugo Platform and Services. COSIE Private Limited is a company incorporated in India with GSTIN: 33GZTPM7252L1ZJ, having its registered office at Plot 12, Thamarai Kannan St., Etti Annal Nagar, Poonamallee, Chennai-600  056,  Tamil  Nadu,  India.  The  Merchant  is  the  business  entity  you represent. Throughout these Terms, the following definitions apply ? "Entugo  Platform"  refers  to  the  cloud-based  software,  web  portals, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and mobile experiences branded "Entugo". ? "Service(s)" encompasses all features detailed in these Terms, including but not  limited  to  QR  designs,  data  capture  functionalities,  automated  discount systems, the loyalty system known as "Tugo Coins", any available add-ons & additional services, customer support, and any new functionality that may be introduced from time to time. ?

                <h2 className="text-2xl text-slate-800 mt-8 mb-4">2. Scope of Entugo Services</h2>
                <p className="mb-4">
                    [COSIE  provides  the  Entugo  Platform  which  offers  several  Services  designed  to enhance customer engagement and loyalty. These Services include the generation of Creative QR Codes, which can be standard designs selectable by the Merchant within the  Entugo  environment  or  custom  designs  commissioned  as  an  Add-On.  The Services  facilitate  Data  Capture  &  Review  Prompts,  whereby  End  Users,  upon scanning a QR code, complete a short form and are subsequently redirected to the Merchant's designated Google review page or feedback page. A key feature is the provision of Automated Discounts. Upon verified submission of a review by an End User, Entugo automatically emails a discount QR code to that End User. This discount code is valid for a period of certain days which can be preselected by the merchant, after which the discount value automatically reduces as configured. The Entugo Platform includes a Loyalty System called "Tugo Coins". End Users earn Tugo Coins as a percentage of their bill amount on eligible redemptions of offers or discounts. This functions as a typical loyalty system, and the coin-to-value ratio is fixed by the COSIE. There is no minimum threshold for earning coins. Tugo Coins do not expire unless the Merchant terminates their Entugo account, as detailed in Section 11 (Term, Suspension, and Termination). For  businesses  with  takeaway  services,  Entugo  offers  an  optional  Delivery-to-Dine Conversion feature, which involves mini-QR stickers designed for takeaway packaging to  encourage  repeat  business.  Merchants  have  access  to  a  comprehensive Dashboard  &  Analytics  tool,  providing  real-time  insights  into  review  generation, discount  redemption  rates,  loyalty  balances  of  End  Users,  and  overall  campaign performance. Support is provided via email at support@entugo.com, with optional on-site onboarding services available. Upon an End User's first completion of the Entugo digital form and successful verification of their contact details, an Entugo Account is  automatically  created  for  that  End  User.  Through  this  account  the  End  User can:present their Tugo Card at point of sale; view and track their Tugo Coin balance and  any  Tugo  Rewards  earned  across  participating  Merchants;  update  their  saved Personal Data and communication preferences. When the same End User scans an Entugo QR code at a new Merchant, they may simply log in to their existing Entugo Account and opt-in to share their profile with that Merchant  no need to complete a fresh data-capture form. The Merchant agrees not to require re-entry of information already  contained  in  the  Entugo  Account  unless  additional  details  are  strictly necessary for lawful processing and are requested with the End User's consent. All data sharing under this mechanism remains subject to these Terms, the Entugo End-User Terms & Conditions, the Entugo Privacy Policy, and applicable law]

                <p className="mb-4">
                    [Subscription Fees for the Entugo Services are billed monthly in advance, or as per the terms of an upfront multi-month or annual plan selected by the Merchant. All payments are processed through our PCI-DSS compliant payment partner. Fees are displayed and charged in Indian Rupees (?). Applicable Indian Goods & Services Tax (GST) will be applied to  the Subscription Fees at the prevailing rates. COSIE's GSTIN will be displayed on each tax invoice issued to the Merchant. In  the  event  of  a  payment  failure  for  the  Subscription  Fee,  COSIE  will  attempt  to process the payment up to three (3) times within a seven (7) day period. If payment is not successfully processed after seven (7) days of the due date, COSIE reserves the right to suspend access to the Services. If non-payment continues for fourteen (14) consecutive days, COSIE may terminate the Merchant's account and access to the Services. Plan changes, such as upgrades to a higher tier, will take effect immediately upon  payment  of  any  pro-rated  difference.  Downgrades  or  cancellations  of  a subscription  will  take  effect  at  the  end  of  the  current  paid term,  as  further  detailed below. Our refund and cancellation policy is as follows: ? Free Trial: If the Merchant is on a 7-day free trial, cancellation within this trial period will result in no amount charged, and all QR codes associated with the account will deactivate immediately.
                    ? Monthly  Plan:  If  the  Merchant  is  on  a  monthly  subscription  plan,  they  may cancel at any time. No refund will be provided for the current month  already paid, but the Service will remain active until the end of that billing period. ?

Service Outage: In the event of  a Service outage exceeding 48  continuous hours,  not  caused  by  Force  Majeure  events  (as  defined  in  Section  13),  the Merchant will be eligible for a service credit. This credit will be equal to one-thirtieth (1/30) of the monthly Subscription Fee for each full 24-hour block of downtime, capped at a maximum credit equivalent to one month's Subscription Fee. All refunds will be processed to the original payment method used by the Merchant. COSIE  is  not  liable  for  any  differences  in  refunded  amounts  in  case  of  foreign exchange rate fluctuations or any charges imposed by the Merchant's bank.

                <p className="mb-4">
                    [COSIE is committed to protecting the privacy and security of both Customer Data and the personal information of our Merchants. This Section outlines our data processing practices. COSIE processes Customer Data (as defined in Section 1, referring to End User  information)  as  a  joint  Data  Fiduciary  with  the  Merchant  under  the  Digital Personal  Data  Protection Act,  2023  (DPDPA  2023). As  joint  Data  Fiduciaries,  both COSIE and the Merchant have defined rights and responsibilities for the processing of Customer Data collected through the Merchant's use of the Services. The Merchant is primarily responsible for obtaining initial lawful, specific, and informed consent from End Users (Data Principals under the DPDPA 2023) for the collection and processing of their data via the Entugo Platform for the core Services. COSIE also collects and processes personal and business information directly from the Merchant (including its Business Representative) to establish and manage the Entugo account and provide the Services. This Privacy Policy section applies to both Customer Data and Merchant Data. COSIE has the right to process Customer Data in accordance with these Terms and the  consents  obtained.  Customer  Data  collected  through  the  Entugo  Platform  is processed by COSIE for the following purposes: (i) To deliver, maintain, operate, and improve  the  Entugo  Platform  and  the  Services  provided  to  the  Merchant  and  End Users;  (ii)  To  facilitate  the  core  functionalities  of  the  Service,  such  as  sending incentives (e.g., automated discounts) to End Users as configured by the Merchant; (iii)  To  provide  analytics,  reports,  and  insights  to  the  Merchant  regarding  their campaigns  and  End User engagement;  (iv) For  COSIE's own  direct  marketing and promotional  communications  to  End  Users  regarding  Entugo's  existing  or  new products,  services,  features,  and offers,  provided  that  appropriate explicit,  specific, and informed consent has been obtained from the End User for such communications in  compliance  with  the  DPDPA  2023  and  other  applicable  Indian  laws;  and  (v)  To enable or facilitate, directly or indirectly, marketing communications from or on behalf of other businesses or third-party partners to End Users, provided always that such use is based on explicit, specific, and freely given consent obtained from the End User for such specific purpose and disclosure to such third parties, in strict accordance with the  DPDPA  2023  and  other  applicable  Indian  laws.  COSIE  and  the  Merchant acknowledge their shared responsibility to ensure that any processing of  Customer Data,  particularly  for  marketing  purposes  beyond  the  direct  provision  of  the  core Services requested by the End User through the Merchant, is founded on a valid legal basis,  typically  explicit  End  User  consent  that  is  clearly  distinguishable  from  other matters, informed, and unambiguous, in line with the DPDPA 2023. To provide and manage the Services effectively and lawfully, COSIE collects certain information  directly  from  the  Merchant.  This  Merchant  Data  includes:  Identity  & Contact  Data,  such  as  the  authorised  representative's  name,  designation,  email, phone number, and  official  business  address;  Business Credentials,  including legal entity  details  (e.g.,  trade  name  etc..)

We process Merchant  Data  only  when  a  lawful  basis  exists,  such  as:  Contractual Necessity,  to open and maintain your ENTUGO account, configure campaigns, issue invoices, and provide  support;  Legal  Obligation,  to  satisfy  Indian  tax,  accounting,  and  KYC/AML requirements;  Legitimate  Interest,  to  prevent  fraud,  ensure  information  security, enhance Platform features through aggregated analytics, and defend legal claims; and Consent, for sending optional product newsletters and promotional updates, which you may withdraw at any time without affecting prior processing by contacting us or using unsubscribe mechanisms. COSIE is committed to ensuring the security of all personal data. Customer Data and Merchant  Data  are  hosted  on Amazon  Web Services (AWS) servers located  in  the Mumbai region (India), supporting in-country data localisation as per Indian regulatory requirements.  COSIE  implements  and  maintains  appropriate  technical  and organisational security measures designed to protect all personal data, compliant with relevant standards such as ISO/IEC 27001 and in accordance with the DPDPA 2023. These measures include, but are not limited to, encryption of data in transit (e.g., TLS 1.2+)  and  at  rest  (e.g.,  AES-256),  role-based  access  controls,  multi-factor authentication,  continuous  monitoring  of  our  systems,  and  quarterly  penetration testing to safeguard personal data. We  never  sell  your  personal  information.  We  may  disclose  Merchant  Data,  and Customer  Data  where  necessary  and  legally  permissible  (e.g.,  where  COSIE  has direct  responsibility  or  acts  as  a  processor  for  the  Merchant),  only  as  follows:  to Authorised  Service  Providers,  such  as  PCI?DSS  compliant  payment  gateways, Google Cloud (Mumbai region) for hosting, CRM platforms, and email/SMS gateways, all  of  whom  are  bound  by  strict  data?processing  agreements  and  confidentiality obligations; to our Affiliates & Advisers, including auditors, lawyers, and accountants, under confidentiality obligations for legitimate business and legal purposes; to Legal Authorities, when mandated by law, subpoena, or court order, or when necessary to protect  the  rights,  property,  or  safety  of  COSIE,  our  Merchants,  End  Users,  or  the public; and in connection with Business Transitions, such as a merger, acquisition, or sale  of  assets, where  data  may  be  transferred  subject  to  the  new entity  upholding privacy safeguards equivalent to or stronger than those described herein. COSIE will assist the Merchant in addressing requests received from End Users (Data Principals) who are exercising their rights under the DPDPA 2023 (such as rights to access information about personal data, correction and erasure of personal data, and grievance  redressal  concerning  their  Customer  Data).  Such  assistance  and coordination  regarding End  User requests will primarily be  facilitated through  email communication.  Both  COSIE  and  the  Merchant  shall  cooperate  in  good  faith  to address such End User requests  in accordance with their respective obligations as joint  Data  Fiduciaries  under  the  DPDPA  2023.  Merchants  also  possess  rights regarding  their  own  personal  data  processed  by  COSIE.  In  accordance  with  the DPDPA  2023  and  other  relevant  regulations,  Merchants  have  the  right  to  request access to, correction of, and, in certain circumstances, deletion of their personal data. Merchants  may  also  withdraw  their  consent  for  receiving  direct  marketing communications  at  any  time  and  have  the  right  to  file  a  complaint  with  the  Data Protection Board of India if they have concerns about our data processing practices. To exercise these rights concerning their personal data, or for any requests regarding their  data  processed  by  COSIE,  Merchants  should  contact  us  by  emailing contact@cosie.io. We will make reasonable efforts to address such requests within the legally mandated timeframe, though certain requests may be limited, for example, if retention of data is required by law or for legitimate business purposes. COSIE will notify the Merchant without undue delay, and in any event generally within 72 hours, upon becoming aware of a personal data breach affecting Customer Data for which COSIE has a primary responsibility. This is in addition to COSIE's obligations to notify the  Data  Protection Board of India and affected  Data Principals as required  by  the DPDPA 2023. The Merchant agrees to promptly notify COSIE of any personal data breach  originating  from  the  Merchant's  systems  or  personnel  that  affects  data processed in connection with the Entugo Services.  Upon termination or expiry of the Merchant's subscription, the Merchant will have a period of thirty (30) days to export Customer Data related to their End Users from the Entugo  Platform  by  requesting  COSIE,  by  mailing  support@entugo.com.  Merchant Data will be retained by COSIE throughout the duration of your subscription and for an  additional  period  of  eight  (8) years  thereafter  to  meet  statutory  record?keeping obligations (e.g., under tax and company laws), after which it will be either securely deleted or irreversibly anonymised. Detailed information on COSIE's data processing practices concerning End Users, the management of End User consents, and the full scope of rights of End Users (Data Principals) are further described in Entugo's dedicated Privacy Policy for end users. This  End  User  Privacy  Policy  is  made  available  to  End  Users  at  the  point  of  data collection, clearly explains their rights under the DPDPA 2023, and forms an integral part  of  the  agreement  with  End  Users,  complementing  these  Terms.  This  Privacy Policy section within the Terms of Service may be updated from time to time to reflect changes  in  our services  or  legal requirements. We  will indicate the  "Last  Updated" date at the top of these Terms. Your continued use of the Entugo Services after any such updates signifies your acknowledgment and agreement to the revised terms.
